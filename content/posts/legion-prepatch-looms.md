Hello and welcome back to RaidAdvice. Who's excited for the Legion prepatch ([coming in a few days on July 19, 2016](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20176410/the-legion-pre-expansion-patch-arrives-july-19-7-15-2016))? Guide availability for the prepatch is spotty right now, and several writers are waiting to release guides until the patch drops. Check back in a week or two for my first-draft list of prepatch class guides. Before Legion hits, there's a few raid-oriented posts I intend to release, so be on the lookout for those as well! For now, there's a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/comments/4t1wqx/class_guides_for_patch_70/) with information on several guides, and some class websites (links available from the [Class Guides Tier 18 page](http://raidadvice.com/class-guides-tier-18/)) have forums where folks areÂ starting to theorycraft. Class discord channels and IRC have some good guides forming/promised as well. If you know of a good guide, feel free to leave a comment here, or contact me directly (my contact information is available in the [about page](http://raidadvice.com/about/)).
