Per the [7.2 patch notes](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20629899/world-of-warcraft-7-2-the-tomb-of-sargeras-patch-notes), the best Legion feast ([Lavish Suramar Feast](http://www.wowhead.com/item=133579/lavish-suramar-feast))Â grants 500 main stat (up from 200) in 7.2. This means that for most classes, feasts will be better than all other food options. Even the lesser feast ([Hearty Feast](http://www.wowhead.com/item=133578/hearty-feast)) will grant 400 main stat. If you cook your own food and don't have rank 3 of the feasts, you might want to [head back to Nomi](http://raidadvice.com/how-to-target-specific-recipes-from-nomi/) with some materials. Make sure your raid group is ready to feast on some feasts!
