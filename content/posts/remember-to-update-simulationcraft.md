Remember to keep [Simcraft updated](http://simulationcraft.org/download.html)! I got better gear and my simulated damage went down. I made sure to use the [Simulationcraft addon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/simulationcraft) to import (apparently it can avoid glitches with importing from armory) and updated Simcraft. My simmed damage went up, which was as expected. Thanks to my Shammy buddy who suggested I try updating - it worked. Make sure to keep Simcraft up to date for accurate results.
