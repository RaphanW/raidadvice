Patch 7.2 is coming this week (worry not, the new raid is still months out). If you routinely do a 15 keystone each week, you may want to do an 18 this week. Why? Starting with 7.2, each level will get more difficult, and a 10+ generates the maximum reward (of a 905 in your weekly cache). More significantly to this post, for this week only, if you do an 18 you will get a 10 in your bags next week. See this blue post for more information: [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753795211#1](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753795211#1). Key you get next week based on highest key completed this week:

> Mythic 2-8: level 2 Keystone Mythic 9-10: level 3 Mythic 11: level 4 Mythic 12: level 5 Mythic 13-14: level 6 Mythic 15: level 7 (each difficulty level above 15 increases next week’s Keystone level by 1)

Or, if you want to run lots of mythic plus next week for AP, consider doing only a level 10 this week, as that will generate the (maximum) 905 gear reward next week and you will start with a 3-level key you can run many times:

> To put it more directly: completing a Keystone dungeon of difficulty 10 or higher this week will result in a reward with a minimum item level of 905 in your next weekly chest, which is the current maximum reward in Patch 7.2.

A tidbit for next week: Do the intro quest in the Broken Isles first thing, it leads to getting Artifact Knowledge 26 instantly, which increases AP gains by something like 400% over level 25. Only after doing that should you open your weekly cache (which rewards Artifact Power now) (EDIT 2017-3-27: [the weekly cache will not reward AP the first week of 7.2](https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/846418523337371648)), do world quests, dungeons, etc. Do you know of any more things like this to do this weekend to be prepared for 7.2?
