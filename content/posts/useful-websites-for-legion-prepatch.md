[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is the new voice program taking over many gaming communities with its crisp, free voice-chat and very useful text channels (EDIT: see [this list of Discord channels for Legion](http://raidadvice.com/world-of-warcraft-legion-useful-discord-channels/)). There are several community-run wow-related discord servers, including [this one](https://discord.gg/wow) for WoW in general and [these](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/16114-class-discord-channels/) for each class. Check these channels if you want to stay tuned for the very latest theory-crafting. You can also make a free server for your guild. [http://www.wowhead.com/](http://www.wowhead.com/): Wowhead, already very useful in general, seems to be stepping up its class guides game for Legion (navigate from [http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes)). [http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides](http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides) - A very reasonable starting off point for class guides, with the best guide available for some specs. The Icy-Veins forums also have bits of useful discussion. [http://www.mmo-champion.com/](http://www.mmo-champion.com/): This site, like wowhead, has periodic updates about wow, as well has having very well-trafficked [forums](http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/247-Class-Discussions), which have the best theorycrafting available for some classes. [http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/): This reddit subreddit is an official wow community site and has good, active discussion about wow. [http://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/](http://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/): This reddit subreddit is narrowly focused on high-level wow raiding. There are detailed guides, log analysis posts, and more. [http://simplearmory.com/](http://simplearmory.com/): This website allows an alternative view of the wow armory. The collectibles, mounts section links to a good guide for mount farming and tells what you missed at a glance. [http://bossblueprint.com/wow](http://bossblueprint.com/wow): This website is a great way to quickly outline raid positioning strategies for HFC.
