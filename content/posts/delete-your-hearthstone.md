If you don't love special events, the recent Diablo-themed Warcraft event may have caused your eyes to glaze over. You may have missed the limited-availability [Tome of Town Portal](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142542/tome-of-town-portal). This toy is obtained easily by killing and looting 5 or soÂ [Treasure Goblins](http://ru.wowhead.com/npc=116041/treasure-goblin). They appear in various places - the easiest place to farm them is the Dalaran Underbelly, where they appear every few minutes. It shares a cooldown with and has the same functionality as a Hearthstone, but it is a toy so it doesn't take up bag space. Move aside Hearthstone - the Tome has arrived!

Woot! I need the bag space. I need the Action Bar space more, for certain sure. But if I 'favorite' the toy, I can quick open my collections. With the Innkeeper's Daughter, I could only use it on the character who did the digs -- I hope this Tome is account-wide!
