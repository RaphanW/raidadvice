Here are some useful tips that will help you prepare for the launch of World of Warcraft: Legion. For even more resources you may not have encountered, check out the [class guides](http://raidadvice.com/class-guides-legion-prepatch/) or [general raiding guides](http://raidadvice.com/general-raiding-guides/) (both are also linked in the navigation bar). It has always been a dream of mine to write a useful [List of N Things](http://www.paulgraham.com/nthings.html) blog post with a [catchy title](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/psychology-of-clickbait/). Enjoy!

Swag Your Spellbook
===================

When Blizzard [reworked the Glyph system with the 7.0 Legion prepatch](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20151961/legion-pre-expansion-patch-notes), several classes lost cosmetic effects. Some will be available again from Inscription Glyphs when Legion launches. Others are available for you now! Are you a Druid missing your stag appearance? A Shaman that misses making it rain (of frogs)? Check out [this Reddit post with a list of vendors that sell cosmetic enhancements](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4tr061/there_are_vendors_throughout_the_world_who_sell/). Some like [Quartermaster Miranda Breechlock](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=11536/quartermaster-miranda-breechlock) in Eastern Plaguelands sell only a few items (she sells a [Contemplation Tome](http://www.wowhead.com/item=136801/divine-tome-contemplation) for Paladins and a [nifty toy](http://www.wowhead.com/item=136928/thaumaturgists-orb) for Priests). Others like [Lorelae Wintersong](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=12022/lorelae-wintersong) in Moonglade sell many Tomes - any Druids looking for [Flap](http://www.wowhead.com/item=136794/tome-of-the-wilds-flap) or cosmetic effects should check her out. Speaking of Flap, if you are a Balance Druid, check out the [FlappyBirb weakaura](https://wago.io/4k38vaEub) which creates some mini-games based on Flapping!

Enhance Your Exploring
======================

Preach made a [great video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWdybMztTss) with some Legion leveling tips. Some folks on Reddit [summarized and discussed his recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4ww5fg/preachgaming_legion_levelling_hints_and_tips/) - definitely worth a read-through. A few other tips and tricks threads have popped up on Reddit: here's [another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4xns8f/helpful_tips_from_my_beta_experience_so_far/) I found useful. Make sure to plan your attack so you hit the ground running once the expansion drops.

Analyze Your Artifact Weapons
=============================

Poneria wrote a [lengthy article](https://felconcentration.wordpress.com/2016/07/12/multispeccing-artifacts/) on the math behind leveling up multiple artifact weapons. Check it out to get a better understanding of where you should be spending your artifact power. My executive summary? Two fully-filled artifact weapons (a main spec and one offspec) is doable. But once you get to the hidden "percentage improvement" traits, you want to focus on one main spec early on in Legion. The artifact power costs of each additional percentage will get prohibitively high for multiple specs. If you are interested in looking at more artifact weapon numbers, check out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11xQCzhiVM9gTZkUsu1UNs7z4dpwHpRQSUUZySY7xLv0/) by Kibo.

Automate Backing Up Your Addons
===============================

[This guide on the official Blizzard Battle.net forums](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/18300739344) explains how you can automate backing up your addons (and their settings) to your favorite cloud storage provider - at no additional cost! Once everything is set up, you can also sync addons between different computers. The process is a bit involved and requires some tech savvy, so proceed with caution. For a paid alternative, consider [Curse Premium](https://mods.curse.com/premium), which includes an [addons backup and sync feature](https://support.curse.com/hc/en-us/articles/204269785-AddOn-Sync-Settings-Backup).

Calculate Your Cooldowns
========================

As I noted in my [recent post on User Interface](http://raidadvice.com/updating-my-addons-and-user-interface-for-the-legion-prepatch/), [Weakauras](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2) can be a great way to manage your cooldowns. I also noted that it can often be a good start - and sometimes finish - to borrow Weakauras from someone else. Several Weakauras repository websites are popping up for Legion. They include [weakauras.online](https://www.weakauras.online) and [wago.io](https://wago.io). As someone who is very likely going to main Balance Druid, I love [Cyrous's Weakauras on wago.io](https://wago.io/p/Cyous). Restoration is my favorite offspec, and [Ablution's Weakauras](https://www.weakauras.online/en/user/show/ablution) on weakauras.online are a great resource for Restoration Druids as well as Holy and Discipline Priests.

Optimize Your Offspec
=====================

Are you still considering what class to pick or what offspec you should prioritize? Are you wondering what specs have secondary stat priorities that mesh well, so you don't have to maintain two separate sets of gear? If so, look no further! [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQ3kdYBuMG-xsXcJ6jY-PJSNS5zv0cHmdxX6S6dL1_w/pubhtml), [linked on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4wfan7/to_all_those_worried_about_which_class_to_play/), lays out which specs have synergistic stat priorities. For me, Balance Druid with Restoration Druid offspec has never looked better, with both specs prioritizing Haste then Critical Strike.

Perfect Your Performance
========================

I may have saved the best for last. [This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TiiI4huz4NXKfx7PGvvVTyP6xu8VaDNZ4-FEn69mOhc/pubhtml#), [with discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4wq208/legion_raiders_lexicon/), is a comprehensive guide to the start of Legion. It covers, leveling, professions, gearing, your artifact, and more. It is focused on players who want to immediately gear up a main and an alt for [heroic split runs](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/19740454318). A word of caution: [the original spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1apphJ2vlZL4eQFZMKeUrYC34PsNt7JFeTZiqNtb0NyE/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true) was written in Russian, and is being constantly updated by the creator. The translated English version may become outdated.
