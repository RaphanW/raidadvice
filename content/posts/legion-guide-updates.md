This past weekend, I updated the Legion [class guides compilation](http://raidadvice.com/world-of-warcraft-legion-class-guides/), adding a few new class-specific sites I have heard about in the past few months and altering the recommended guide for a few specs based on community feedback. In the past month or so I have also updated the [Mythic Plus Dungeons Guide](http://raidadvice.com/legion-mythic-plus-dungeons-guide/) and [Withered Training Guide](http://raidadvice.com/withered-training-preparation-tips-and-tricks/), and added some comments to past articles for a bit of clarification. If you found one of those valuable in the past, you might want to check them out again. If you see something that looks like it still needs updating, let me know. As with every guide, try it out in game and make sure it works for you. As much as we all might like some [Khadgar Admiration](http://raidadvice.com/khadgar-admiration/), you can't believe everything you read.
