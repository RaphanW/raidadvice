Hello there! Sorry to anyone who was a loyal reader and noticed I abruptly stopped updating the site a few years back. My dad was sick, got much sicker, and then passed away, and during that time period I quit Warcraft and blogging.

I still play games now, in August of 2020 that's mostly Fortnite (with some Fall Guys).

Players don't seem too optimistic about Shadowlands. If it's great I might come back to raiding. However, I avoided coming back for BfA raiding, and that now seems like it was a good move. Unless raider feedback about Shadowlands improves, I'll probably stay away for Shadowlands as well.

I spent a day moving the site from Wordpress on Digital Ocean to a static site (I chose Hugo, but there are [tons of options](https://www.staticgen.com/)), which is why things look different now. The site is now hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I am glad to reduce my costs from $130/year to $10/year for a site I haven't been updating.

I haven't gone through the effort of enabling comments, which is a bit tricky with static sites. If you want to say hi, or want to comment on this or another post, send me a twitter DM at [RaphanW](https://twitter.com/RaphanW) or an e-mail (address available in the [About Page](/about/)). If you want it to be a public comment, just send me a link to the post you want me to add it to.
