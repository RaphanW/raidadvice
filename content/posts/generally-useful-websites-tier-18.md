[http://www.wowhead.com/](http://www.wowhead.com/): Wowhead maintains news, guides, and a searchable database of every item in the game. If you have a question about something in wow, this is a great first place to look. [http://www.mmo-champion.com/](http://www.mmo-champion.com/): This site has periodic updates about wow, as well has having very well-trafficked forums. [http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/): This reddit subreddit is an official wow community site and has good, active discussion about wow. [http://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/](http://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/): This reddit subreddit is narrowly focused on high-level wow raiding. There are detailed guides, log analysis posts, and more. [http://simplearmory.com/](http://simplearmory.com/): This website allows an alternative view of the wow armory. The collectibles, mounts section links to a good guide for mount farming and tells what you missed at a glance.
