[Nomicakes](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/nomicakes): This addon will show you what Cooking recipes can be gained from which materials you give to [Nomi](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=64337/nomi)Â in Dalaran. Simply give as many materials as you can for the recipe(s) you are targeting, and Nomi has a chance of teaching you those recipe(s). Aside from that, all we know is that it's a grind and a low chance per batch of materials at this point. Best of luck to you, may Nomi's odds be ever in your favor!
