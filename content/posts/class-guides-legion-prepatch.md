(Revised August 12, 2016) **\*\*\*\*\*\*****\*\*\*\*\*\*****\*\*\*\*\*\*** **EDIT: Updated guide links for Legion now at [http://raidadvice.com/world-of-warcraft-legion-class-guides/](http://raidadvice.com/world-of-warcraft-legion-class-guides/)!** **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*** Know a better option? Suggest a guide! Leave a comment below, or contact me via the options listed in the [about page](http://raidadvice.com/about/). A few warnings about this page: First, many guides are listed because they are the only guide available; quality may vary. Second, patch changes may quickly make the guides below out of date, so proceed with caution. For the prepatch, many writers have gone with FAQ-type documents rather than guides, as everything - rotations, talents, etc. - are in flux from tuning patch to tuning patch as Blizzard gets each spec to where they want it to be. Third, to repeat the message from the first paragraph, if you know a great guide I should consider including, please let me know. I only play a few specs, so with guides being released frequently I can use **your help** to make this list the best it can be. Also, I know of some guides coming in the next few days that were not up when I checked to first make this post. Feel free to let me know when they are up! Enjoy, and have a happy prepatch!

Death Knight: Blood
===================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) [This brief google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFaFHVaNX0k__unh18Uc2nHdL9hMMHIcHQYb4t2vnEc/edit) is the only Blood Death Knight prepatch guide that I am aware of. The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Death Knight: Frost
===================

(Revised August 1, 2016) [This Frost google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SMnE5LxMrFPEKk043NONHzjmirUjVFIE6tTJ3C08QPo/edit?usp=sharing) is more of a FAQ than a guide. It's the best I've seen for Frost info for the prepatch. This YouTube video by JaceDK goes over Frost DK for the prepatch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRfL5vRN9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMRfL5vRN9A). Video by Frostelion: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6K8FeUClm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6K8FeUClm8). The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Death Knight: Unholy
====================

(Revised August 1, 2016) [This Unholy google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jn7O1uMXjugGjwL_NWWQqfZXUz7wgVo7yri1b3N9lTs/edit?usp=sharing) is more of a FAQ than a guide. It's the best I've seen for Unholy info for the prepatch. Two YouTube videos by Frostelion and Mooniara that go over Unholy DK for the prepatch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJbqlYfkEXY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJbqlYfkEXY) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPtNovgvUI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPtNovgvUI0)  Bonus: Check out [this weakaura set](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4v4n7g/unholy_dk_rotation_helper_weakaura/). The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Bonus: Check out the weakauras in [this thread](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2025507-Legion-Druid-Weakaura-s-Thread) on MMO-Champion. I have not found a reliable discussion forum for Balance.

============

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) Check out [Xanzara's Feral Guide](http://fluiddruid.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5714) at fluiddruid. [http://www.fluiddruid.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=3](http://www.fluiddruid.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=3) - Fluid Druid forums have some good feral DPS discussion, and are a good first place to look.

Druid: Restoration
==================

I have not found a reliable discussion forum for Restoration Druid.

Hunter: All
===========

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) Prepatch guides for hunter are available at [http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides](http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides). They are written by Azortharion who maintained a great Tier 18 hunter guide. Wowhead also has prepatch guides for hunter (navigate from [http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes)). The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Mage: All
=========

(Revised August 1, 2016) [Fire mage prepatch guide](http://www.altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2553) by Rinoa on altered-time.com forums. Fire is the spec to play prepatch. However, see [this amusing frost guide](http://www.altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2555&sid=a0c1c5986fd995b188fa91e9355a56af). The forums at [http://Altered-Time.com](http://altered-time.com) are a great place for mage discussion for all three specs.

Monk: Brewmaster
================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) [http://sunniersartofwar.com/](http://sunniersartofwar.com/) has a [prepatch survival guide](http://sunniersartofwar.com/blog/2016/07/16/brewmaster-patch-7-0-survival-guide/). BrewingScribe made the [guide for wowhead](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/monk/brewmaster/overview).

Monk: Mistweaver
================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) A prepatch guide is available at [http://cranehealing.blogspot.com/2016/07/legion-mistweaver-guide-fistweaving.html](http://cranehealing.blogspot.com/2016/07/legion-mistweaver-guide-fistweaving.html). Misty Teahouse has started [their prepatch guide](http://www.mistyteahouse.com/legion/mistweaver-guide-updated-for-patch-7-0/) as well.

Monk: Windwalker
================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) [http://www.walkingthewind.com/guides/tldr](http://www.walkingthewind.com/guides/tldr)/ by Babylonius. This is a great, concise prepatch guide for windwalker.

Paladin: Holy
=============

(Revised August 12, 2016) Check out this detailed guide at [Sacred Shielding](https://sacredshielding.wordpress.com/2016/08/02/holy-paladin-guide-for-legion/), and the briefer [wowhead guide](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/paladin/holy/overview). The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of, but they can be hit or miss.

Paladin: Protection
===================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) Check out [this guide](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747294843?page=1#1) on the official forums by Liminara (or a [wowhead version](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/paladin/protection/overview)). The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Paladin: Retribution
====================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) [http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657441833](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657441833): this guide is the best prepatch guide for ret that I am aware of. The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Priest: Discipline
==================

(Revised August 10, 2016) This [discipline prepatch guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/priest/discipline/overview) was written by Jak, the writer of a great Tier 18 guide. [http://howtopriest.com](http://howtopriest.com) has been a great one-stop shop resource for priests in Tier 18. Discipline is going to be a **very** complicated spec to play in Legion. And, depending on Blizzard's tuning, the rewards may be great or they may be marginal.

Priest: Holy
============

(Revised August 10, 2016) This [wowhead guide](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/priest/holy/overview) by Jak, writer of a great Tier 18 guide, looks solid. [http://howtopriest.com](http://howtopriest.com) has been a great one-stop shop resource for priests in Tier 18.

Priest: Shadow
==============

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) I am aware of [this guide on howtopriest](http://howtopriest.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=8402), [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYAMA3LCqcKrPOofDXYY6DAyH74Exheh7Ie1DN8qIw4/edit), and [this wowhead guide](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/priest/shadow/overview) as far as prepatch guides go. [http://howtopriest.com](http://howtopriest.com) has been a great one-stop shop resource for priests in Tier 18. I don't see any prepatch guides yet, however. The MMO-Champion forum is a strong alternate resource for shadow priests.

Rogue: All
==========

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) Prepatch guides for rogue are available at [http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides](http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides). Wowhead also has prepatch guides for rogue (navigate from [http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes)). Quality may vary. [http://ravenholdt.net/](http://ravenholdt.net/) - This rogue-only site has discussion forums. The MMO-Champion forums are also strong.

Shaman: Elemental
=================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) The best prepatch guide I am aware of for elemental is Binkenstein's guide, hosted on wowhead: [http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/shaman/elemental/overview](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/shaman/elemental/overview). See also his blog at ([http://binkenstein.wordpress.com](http://binkenstein.wordpress.com)). I have not found a reliable discussion forum for Elemental.

Shaman: Enhancement
===================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) Wordup continues theorycrafting for enhancement with [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TGTyAY1SxhFud0aVzJNnOrxHHhz5szzAssBp8Kk0o_8/edit) (and this [wowhead guide](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/shaman/enhancement/overview)). The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Shaman: Restoration
===================

(Reviewed August 1, 2016) Chain Heal ([http://chainheal.com/](http://chainheal.com/)) doesn’t really have “one guide,” prefering smaller articles on different aspects of Shaman healing. However, it does have some excellent tips, including some prepatch discussion.

Warlock: All
============

(Revised August 1, 2016) Check out [this Demonology guide](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2029996-Legion-Not-s-Demonology-Guide) by Not on MMO-Champion. Demonology is the best spec prepatch, but check out [this Affliction guide](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20747875438) if you are interested. Wowhead also has prepatch guides for warlock (navigate from [http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes)). Quality may vary. The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.

Warrior: All
============

(Revised August 1, 2016) [Protection guide](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2030070-7-0-Guide-Protection-Back-with-Vengeance) on MMO-Champion. Wowhead has prepatch guides for warrior (navigate from [http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes)). The official forums have guides for [Arms](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747264886) and [Fury](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747195056). Quality may vary. Bonus: Check out [these weakauras](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4v7acu/weak_auras_for_all_warrior_specs_and_talents/). The MMO-Champion.com forums are the best forums for discussion that I am aware of.
