For learning the fights in Tomb of Sargeras, start with the in-game dungeon journal. Then head to some out-of-game Tomb of Sargeras specific resources. Here are some of the ones I used, in rough order from least to most-detailed:

*   [MMo-Champion Minimalist Guide](http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6517-World-of-Warcraft-Tomb-of-Sargeras-Minimalist-Raid-Guide)
*   [1-2 Minute Youtube Overviews](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvcq2yEgGseZPkpsamTqgJ2R3lQKP7yGN)
*   ["Hardcoded Asian Guide" - Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I2QbAowMgD2SEAvR9eMT5cMY9JyHZ7ehuViMjct1f5I/edit?usp=sharing)
*   [Icy-Veins Written Guides](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/tomb-of-sargeras-raid)
*   [PhoGuild - Written Forum Post Strategies](http://phoguild.enjin.com/forum/viewforum/8375219/m/39307077)

Detailed video guides will likely become available in the next week. Several folks made some handy weakauras for Tomb, such as [these](https://wago.io/Vyfk0e9-X). I also did personal preparation like [I did for Emerald Nightmare](http://raidadvice.com/preparing-for-the-emerald-nightmare/). Check out that article for general preparation tips applicable to all tiers. Good luck with the raid!
