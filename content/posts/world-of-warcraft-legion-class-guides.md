\[toc\]

Death Knight: Blood
===================

(Revised February 19, 2017) [This guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/death-knight/blood/overview) is the best for blood of which I am aware. [This brief google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFaFHVaNX0k__unh18Uc2nHdL9hMMHIcHQYb4t2vnEc/edit) is a fun read.

Death Knight: Frost
===================

(Revised February 19, 2017) [The guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/death-knight/frost/overview) is the best available for Frost DKs.

Death Knight: Unholy
====================

(Revised February 19, 2017) [This guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/death-knight/unholy/overview) is the best available for Unholy.

Demon Hunter: Havoc
===================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) [This guide](http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/havoc-demon-hunter-pve-dps-guide) is the best available for Havoc.

Demon Hunter: Vengeance
=======================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) [This guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/demon-hunter/vengeance/overview) is the best available for Vengeance. See also: [http://sunniersartofwar.com/vengeance/](http://sunniersartofwar.com/vengeance/).

Druid: Balance
==============

(Revised February 19, 2017) [This Balance guide](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745626938) by Cyous is the best that I am aware of. [This Balance guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c6-_akHl_Cja-uwg20Gt8R0f12pcw4_qtVcT7LyZW4A/) by Gebuz does not cover everything, but is a very strong second resource and focused more on Mythic raiding. [This FAQ](https://github.com/ellicottsj/BoomkinFAQ/wiki/Boomkin-FAQ) maintains lists several great resources for Balance Druids, including the two aforementioned guides. Bonus: [Cyrous's Balance Druid Weakauras](https://wago.io/4y7qKOBVW); [Nighthold Gear Spreadsheets](http://raidadvice.com/balance-druid-gear-spreadsheets-for-nighthold/); [Nighthold Encounter Thoughts](http://raidadvice.com/balance-druid-encounter-notes-for-heroic-nighthold-talents-and-trinkets/).

Druid: Feral
============

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) There are a few great Feral guides. Check out [Xanzara's Feral Guide](http://fluiddruid.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5714) at fluiddruid or [Tinderhoof's Feral Guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/druid/feral/overview) on wowhead. [http://www.fluiddruid.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=3](http://www.fluiddruid.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=3) - Fluid Druid forums have some good feral DPS discussion, and are a good first place to look.

Druid: Guardian
===============

(Revised February 19, 2017) Check out this [guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guardian-druid-guide) by Arielle of [http://theincbear.com](http://theincbear.com), the go-to spot for bear tanks, with written and video guides and forums.

Druid: Restoration
==================

(Revised March 4, 2017) Lavathing wrote a guide available at [http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/druid/restoration/overview](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/druid/restoration/overview), with plans for more detailed information later at [http://healcraft.net/](http://healcraft.net/) in the future(tm). See [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1615OefCh8ils8Itwb2BY9kyN8ikC_VtIK2uVVHQY3LM/) that outlines Restoration Druid trinkets for Nighthold. See also [this guide](http://www.restokin.com/resto-druid-healing-guide/) on Restokin and [this guide](http://questionablyepic.com/restodruid-sheet/) on Questionably Epic. Bonus: Check out [these Weakauras](https://www.weakauras.online/en/a/g8mV9NmAzk) by Ablution.

Hunter: All
===========

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) Excellent guides for hunter are available at [http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides](http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides). They are written by Azortharion who maintained a great Tier 18 hunter guide.

Mage: All
=========

(Revised February 19, 2017) [Fire mage guide](http://www.altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2553) by Rinoa. Fire is considered the spec to play in early Legion, although Arcane and Frost are getting more competitive. The forums at [http://Altered-Time.com](http://altered-time.com) are a great place for mage discussion for all three specs. In lieu of detailed guides, I share with you [Arcane discussion](https://www.altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2618) and [Frost discussion](https://www.altered-time.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2621).

Monk: Brewmaster
================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) [http://sunniersartofwar.com/](http://sunniersartofwar.com/) has a [great guide](http://sunniersartofwar.com/brewmaster/). BrewingScribe made the [guide for wowhead](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/monk/brewmaster/overview).

Monk: Mistweaver
================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) There are two great guides for Mistweaver: [This one](http://cranehealing.blogspot.com/p/legion-mistweaver-guide-introduction.html) at [cranehealing](http://cranehealing.blogspot.com/). [This one](http://www.mistyteahouse.com/mistweaver-guide/) at [mistyteahouse](http://www.mistyteahouse.com/).

Monk: Windwalker
================

(Revised February 19, 2017) [http://www.walkingthewind.com/guides/wordy/](http://www.walkingthewind.com/guides/wordy/) by Babylonius.

Paladin: Holy
=============

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) Check out this detailed guide at [Sacred Shielding](https://sacredshielding.wordpress.com/2016/08/02/holy-paladin-guide-for-legion/), and the briefer [wowhead guide](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/paladin/holy/overview).

Paladin: Protection
===================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) Check out [this guide](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747294843?page=1#1) on the official forums by Liminara.

Paladin: Retribution
====================

(Revised February 19, 2017) Check out [this guide](http://www.wowhead.com/retribution-paladin-guide) on the wowhead.

Priest: Discipline
==================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) [This guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/priest/discipline/overview) by Jak is great. Discipline is a **very** complicated spec to play in Legion. And, depending on Blizzard's tuning, the rewards may be great or they may be marginal. Bonus: Check out [Ablution's priest Weakauras](https://www.weakauras.online/en/user/show/ablution).

Priest: Holy
============

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) [This guide](http://legion.wowhead.com/guides/classes/priest/holy/overview) by Jak is great. Bonus: Check out [Ablution's priest Weakauras](https://www.weakauras.online/en/user/show/ablution).

Priest: Shadow
==============

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) [This guide on howtopriest](http://howtopriest.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=8402) is great. [http://howtopriest.com](http://howtopriest.com) has been a great one-stop shop resource for priests in the past.

Rogue: All
==========

(Revised February 19, 2017) [This website](http://roguedpsguide.com/stjerns-legion-rogue-overview/) has great guides for all three specs.

Shaman: Elemental
=================

(Revised February 19, 2017) The best guide I am aware of for elemental is Binkenstein's guide, hosted on wowhead: [http://wowhead.com/guides/classes/shaman/elemental/overview](http://wowhead.com/guides/classes/shaman/elemental/overview). See also his blog at ([http://binkenstein.wordpress.com](http://binkenstein.wordpress.com)). See [https://www.stormearthandlava.com/](https://www.stormearthandlava.com/), a site dedicated to Elemental. If you prefer video guides, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI2nYxfJy0E) by [Barokoshama](https://www.twitch.tv/barokoshama) is solid.

Shaman: Enhancement
===================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) Wordup continues theorycrafting for enhancement with [this guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/shaman/enhancement/overview).

Shaman: Restoration
===================

(Reviewed February 19, 2017) Chain Heal ([http://chainheal.com/](http://chainheal.com/)) doesn’t really have “one guide,” preferring smaller articles on different aspects of Shaman healing. However, it does have some excellent tips.

Warlock: All
============

(Revised February 19, 2017) Check out [this Affliction guide](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2039379-Legion-Terryn-s-guide-to-Affliction-Warlock) by Terryn on MMO-Champion. Check out [this Demonology guide](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2029996-Legion-Not-s-Demonology-Guide) by Not on MMO-Champion. Check out [this Destruction guide](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20745707140#post-1) by Aldeen on the official forums.

Warrior: All
============

(Revised February 19, 2017) Tank: [Protection guide](http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2030070-7-0-Guide-Protection-Back-with-Vengeance). DPS: [Arms guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/warrior/arms/overview); [Fury guide](http://www.wowhead.com/guides/classes/warrior/fury/overview). Bonus: Check out [these weakauras](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4v7acu/weak_auras_for_all_warrior_specs_and_talents/).

Other Resources
===============

(Revised September 27, 2016) If you are into class information, three very strong other resources are: [Class Discord Channels](http://raidadvice.com/world-of-warcraft-legion-useful-discord-channels/): These actively discuss each spec and often have resources stickies. They can be a one-stop-shop for most classes. [Wowhead Class Guides](http://www.wowhead.com/classes): Wowhead recruited some great theorycrafters to write their guides for Legion, and you can do a lot worse than checking the Wowhead guide for your class. [MMO-Champion class forums](http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/247-Class-Discussions): These are the best forums for discussing many specs.
