Every World of Warcraft raider should read these guides and check out these tools. They are more important than any class guide, and they apply to every class. Class guides teach how to play a specific class; that will change from patch to patch. These guides and tools teach how to raid, and that knowledge will endure for your entire raiding career. If you know of a good guide, suggest it!
