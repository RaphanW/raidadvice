About this Site
===============

This site strives to compile the best information and guides for World of Warcraft, especially class guides for top-level raiding. I hope that the posts are fun to read and help you get more out of the game. Principles for including guides:

1.  Link only a few, “best” guides, perhaps others as honorable mentions.
2.  Update guides based on community recommendations and feedback.
