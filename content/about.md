About the Author

About this Site
===============

This site is now inactive, and will likely remain so.

During the Legion expansion, this site strived to compile the best information and guides for World of Warcraft, especially raiding guides and class guides for top-level raiding. Principles for including guides:

1.  Link only a few, “best” guides, perhaps others as honorable mentions.
2.  Update guides based on community recommendations and feedback.


Technical Details
===============
I originally built this site with [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and hosted it on Digital Ocean. In August of 2020, I pulled the content with [blog2md](https://github.com/palaniraja/blog2md), and re-built the site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Raphan's WoW raiding history
====================

I raided in Tier 17 on several guilds, ending on Alone of Aerie Peak (their weekend raid team). I finished cutting edge Imperator but the guild did not get mythic Blackhand down in time. 

In Tier 18, I played as a Holy Paladin with the 2-day mythic guild [Cake Plantation](http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/sargeras/Cake+Plantation/rating.tier18). We finished US 167 and were around the 10th US 2-day guild to finish Tier 18. I was an officer and then GM before we wound down the guild.

I raided in Tier 19 as a Balance Druid with several guilds; the last, Trap Run, finished M Gul'dan US 157.  

I raided in Tier 20 and 21 as a Balance Druid with Storm of Stormrage, Kil'Jaeden and Argus both US 154.
