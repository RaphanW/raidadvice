      <description>With a new expansion came new addon needs. I started using these three addons (and one phone app) in World of Warcraft: Legion, and they have made pre-raid gearing much smoother.
Queue for Bonus Reward Heroic Dungeons: Bobsatchels Bobsatchels: The prior addons I had used for finding heroic dungeon satchels did not work in Legion. The humbly named Bobsatchels gets the job done. It has a slick user interface, exactly the options you would want, and most importantly, it works.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to work on my User Interface since my post last week. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover a few more addons and UI tips! Prior UI post: Updating My Addons and User Interface for the Legion Prepatch. [toc]
Enemy Grid In my last post, I listed dozens of addons I find useful and mentioned two addons I had heard of but not yet tried. Enemy Grid is one of them and it is a game changer!</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been playing much Warcraft since my previous guild &amp;lt;Cake Plantation&amp;gt; went on indefinite (and likely permanent) hiatus in April 2016. I poked around a bit on the PTR, and watched a good deal of Beta and PTR streams. But I had little desire to continue farming Hellfire Citadel, having fully geared three separate characters and killed Mythic Archimonde on each. With the Legion prepatch here, I find myself wanting to be ready for raiding.</description>
