    About: What is this? I am writing just a few sentences outlining the things I thought were most important to focus on as a ranged DPS. My guild downed the first 6 bosses in week one of mythic, with me playing Balance Druid. We have also had some good progression on the 7th. This guide comes from that experience. This guide assumes you have completed the bosses in heroic and will not cover heroic mechanics.

    Hey there. I&rsquo;m still around, moderating /r/competitivewow and playing in my guild Storm. I just haven&rsquo;t had anything I felt compelled to blog about. Blizzcon was great. There was a fun panel with Day9 and several Warcraft content creators about how to effectively be a content creator, and a top suggestion was having a consistent release schedule. I&rsquo;ve thought about getting into something like that on the blog. Maybe consistently releasing something on Tuesdays.

    I am heading to Blizzcon 2017! This will be my first Blizzcon- the first time I will visit Los Angeles/Anaheim as well. Aside from &ldquo;go to Disneyland!&rdquo; any tips for the visit? If you read this blog because we are online friends and you are going, be sure to reach out so we can say hi there.
 Comments:  wrathsome - Oct 4, 2017What fun! When it comes to Los Angeles, it is all about time and money.

    A few nights into progression on the last boss in Tomb of Sargeras, here are my thoughts. If you are progressing on it or about to start, these are the things I wish we had all been clearer on beforehand.
Red Orbs:  Change viewing settings to low particle density to dodge red orbs. Dodge red orbs, seriously; dps to boss during that time is not super important compared to making sure you don&rsquo;t die.

    Hey all. I&rsquo;m still around, I&rsquo;ve just been quite busy this summer and posting/making updates has been on the back-burner. I&rsquo;ve gotten your comments &amp; e-mails: I will try to get to updating the class guides &amp; mythic+ pages, but no promises! As my guild works on Maiden of Vigilance, I have some quick thoughts on phase one of the boss that I explained in an imgur image. Maybe it will be of some use to you: https://imgur.

    For learning the fights in Tomb of Sargeras, start with the in-game dungeon journal. Then head to some out-of-game Tomb of Sargeras specific resources. Here are some of the ones I used, in rough order from least to most-detailed:
 MMo-Champion Minimalist Guide 1-2 Minute Youtube Overviews &ldquo;Hardcoded Asian Guide&rdquo; - Google Doc Icy-Veins Written Guides PhoGuild - Written Forum Post Strategies  Detailed video guides will likely become available in the next week.

  </div>
  <div>
    If you don&rsquo;t have all the legendaries for your main spec and want to do something about it, this post is for you. Bad luck protection exists: the more chances you have to get a legendary, the better chance you will have of getting one. Killing a raid boss is one of the highest chances as getting a legendary. You can get legendaries on a fairly consistent basis now (1-2 weeks) if you put the work in.

    Managing the roster of raiders is one of the most difficult parts of running a mythic raiding guild in World of Warcraft. As long as a guild has enough happy raiders showing up to raid every week, the guild will live on and the group will, in all likelihood, defeat more and more bosses. If a raiding guild fails to sustain its roster, it will fade out of existence. This happens enough in Warcraft that it is colloquially referred to as a guild dying to &ldquo;the roster boss.

  <div>
    I have been enjoying my Repurposed Fel Focuser, a reusable item that costs 7500 Nethershards and provides a buff equal to a bit less than half a flask. I was running several easy Mythic+ with guild-members the other day, and one asked why I wasn&rsquo;t using better consumables. I could have been using the full flask (and using Potions of Prolonged Power on cooldown). I have over one million gold, so I could afford the 500 per hour for flask or 1000 gold per hour for potions of prolonged power - but why spend 1500 per hour when we are consistently 3-chesting the Mythic+ dungeons without me doing so?

    </h2>
    

  </div>
  <div>
    Per the 7.2 patch notes, the best Legion feast (Lavish Suramar Feast) grants 500 main stat (up from 200) in 7.2. This means that for most classes, feasts will be better than all other food options. Even the lesser feast (Hearty Feast) will grant 400 main stat. If you cook your own food and don&rsquo;t have rank 3 of the feasts, you might want to head back to Nomi with some materials.
