    There were a great deal of changes announced for 7.1.5 and 7.2 at Blizzcon this weekend. This Reddit post has a good summary. Blizzcon was great, but I am busy enjoying all the 7.1 changes! I haven&rsquo;t been posting much because I haven&rsquo;t wanted to take my free time away from playing to write guides in the detail that I have come to expect of myself.
Druid Changes 7.1 seemed in part to be a love letter to druids.

    Regular readers may have noticed the dearth of posts the past few weeks. In that time, I searched for and found a new guild: Seppuku, a 3/7 M 2-night guild on US-Stormrage. As of this posting, the guild is looking for a few more ranged DPS, hoping to round out the roster to 24-25 raiders.
Why find a new guild? If you are happy in your current guild, you should strongly consider staying there.

  </div>
  <div>
    A post over at Coffee Cakes and Crits showed a creative way to incorporate toys and pets into your mount macro. Fun times. I also discovered recently that Blizzard has updated it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Favorite Mount&rdquo; logic, so you will cast a mount with a ground animation when in non-flying zones and a mount that can fly in flying zones. It seems like they did this on a pretty smart per mount basis - Cenarion War Hippogryph has a goofy run animation with its wings so it casts only in flying zones, but Red Flying Cloud looks nifty on the ground and it casts in both.

  <div>
    Class Guides are great, but logs can be even better in some areas. Guides are a prediction of what will be best for each class, whereas logs tell you exactly what worked. I plan to write a few posts about using logs to improve your play. Today, we&rsquo;ll look at selecting the right talents for your class and spec based on logs. Warcraftlogs has a great rankings feature that lets you examine at a glance what talents the highest ranking players in your class are using.

    EDIT 2016-10-5: This has been patched out. If I had known for sure that it would be, I could have skipped writing this post. Each week, if you completed a Mythic+ dungeon the previous week, you will get a chest in your order hall containing a piece of gear corresponding to the highest Mythic+ dungeon you beat as well as a Mythic+ keystone 2 levels lower than your previous week&rsquo;s keystone.

  </div>
  <div>
    If you play a DPS class, before raid today, you might want to look into whether you are eating the right food. It could be Fishbrul Special. Back in Draenor, Blizzard introduced Felmouth Frenzy. This food did direct damage to your target rather than improving a stat. This type of food is back in Legion with several varieties. From least to most potent: Spiced Rib Roast, Drogbar Style Salmon, and Fishbrul Special.

    </h2>
    

  </div>
  <div>
    In Legion, Innervate is back for Restoration and Balance Druids. Unlike previous versions, this one does not restore mana. It gives 10 seconds of no-mana-usage-casting to the healer it is cast upon. And yes, it is restricted to healers this time around. The Balance Druid version also gives increased haste to the healer it is cast on for the duration with the Rapid Innervation artifact trait. As a Balance Druid, I picked up that trait as my 24th trait, and many Balance Druids should be getting access to it in the near future.

    Nomicakes: This addon will show you what Cooking recipes can be gained from which materials you give to Nomi in Dalaran. Simply give as many materials as you can for the recipe(s) you are targeting, and Nomi has a chance of teaching you those recipe(s). Aside from that, all we know is that it&rsquo;s a grind and a low chance per batch of materials at this point. Best of luck to you, may Nomi&rsquo;s odds be ever in your favor!
