    Here are some useful tips that will help you prepare for the launch of World of Warcraft: Legion. For even more resources you may not have encountered, check out the class guides or general raiding guides (both are also linked in the navigation bar). It has always been a dream of mine to write a useful List of N Things blog post with a catchy title. Enjoy!

    I haven&rsquo;t been playing much Warcraft since my previous guild &lt;Cake Plantation&gt; went on indefinite (and likely permanent) hiatus in April 2016. I poked around a bit on the PTR, and watched a good deal of Beta and PTR streams. But I had little desire to continue farming Hellfire Citadel, having fully geared three separate characters and killed Mythic Archimonde on each. With the Legion prepatch here, I find myself wanting to be ready for raiding.

    Discord is the new voice program taking over many gaming communities with its crisp, free voice-chat and very useful text channels (EDIT: see this list of Discord channels for Legion). There are several community-run wow-related discord servers, including this one for WoW in general and these for each class. Check these channels if you want to stay tuned for the very latest theory-crafting. You can also make a free server for your guild.

    Hello and welcome back to RaidAdvice. Who&rsquo;s excited for the Legion prepatch (coming in a few days on July 19, 2016)? Guide availability for the prepatch is spotty right now, and several writers are waiting to release guides until the patch drops. Check back in a week or two for my first-draft list of prepatch class guides. Before Legion hits, there&rsquo;s a few raid-oriented posts I intend to release, so be on the lookout for those as well!

    This is a quick post on useful websites that do not easily fit into the &ldquo;guides&rdquo; pages. http://www.wowhead.com/: Wowhead maintains news, guides, and a searchable database of every item in the game. If you have a question about something in wow, this is a great first place to look. http://www.mmo-champion.com/: This site has periodic updates about wow, as well has having very well-trafficked forums. http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/: This reddit subreddit is an official wow community site and has good, active discussion about wow.

    This site was started due to dissatisfaction with other guide compilations, which generally seek to host proprietary guides for all classes on one site. Some of these websites are good jumping off points, but, in general, they suffer from being out of date or inaccurate for at least some of the guides. That being said, the best are listed below. http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides - A very reasonable starting off point for people new to raiding.

About This site strives to compile the best guides and information for World of Warcraft top-level raiding. Principles for including guides:
 Link only a few, “best” guides, perhaps others as honorable mentions. Update guides based on community recommendations and feedback.  This site is maintained by me, Raphan. I progressed in Hellfire Citadel as a Holy Paladin with the 2-day mythic guild Cake Plantation (wowprogress).
