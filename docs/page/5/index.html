    Are you an officer in your mythic raiding Warcraft guild? Do you have a hard time setting the 20-person roster for each encounter, figuring out who should come in if a replacement is needed, or making sure that each player gets their fair share of playing time? If so, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. In Tier 18, I designed a roster system based on this Google Sheet. It integrates with Discord and this Weakaura a friend made.

    EDIT 2017-1-18: Check out the 7.1.5 Gear Spreadsheets for Nighthold. As I discussed in my prior post about Preparing for The Emerald Nightmare, it can be useful, after you have done all your other prep, to figure out what gear you should be targeting in the instance. For reference, here is my gear as of last night. I created a spreadsheet, outlining the possible upgrades in the Emerald Nightmare for my class and spec.

    Here&rsquo;s a basic overview of how I prepared for day one of heroic raiding in the Emerald Nightmare. Many of these steps are repeatable tasks you can do yourself, even if you are starting the day before the raid opens up.
Strategies Knowing what is heading your way from the seven bosses of The Emerald Nightmare is probably the most important step you can take at this point. Here are some resources I used:

    As I&rsquo;ve noted before, the Discord channel for your class is a great place to get information about how to play your class and spec well. I recently checked the https://www.reddit.com/r/competitivewow Discord channel list, and wanted to post a list of class channels here as well for your reference. If you want to make sure that guide you read in prepatch is still up-to-date and search for more resources, the Discord channel for your spec is a great first stop.

    (Last updated 2017-1-12) This guide will outline some items to focus on in Suramar to maximize the Nightfallen reputation gains and overall success you have at Withered Army Training. This is not an all-inclusive guide, and will reference other resources on Withered Training that you should check out before starting the training. I wrote this guide because while there are a few great guides on how to clear the scenario, it was harder to find detailed information on how to prepare for the scenario or what to do your first few times.

Mount Up EDIT 2016-10-11: Follow up post here. The following is my Mount Up macro. I assign the &ldquo;favorite mounts&rdquo; icon to it, and enjoy using it to get around in Legion. /dismount /castrandom [mod:alt]Azure Water Strider, Crimson Water Strider /cast [mod:shift]Grand Expedition Yak;[mod:ctrl]Mekgineer's Chopper /cast [flyable]X-53 Touring Rocket /cancelform [stance:1/2] /run C_MountJournal.

    With a new expansion came new addon needs. I started using these three addons (and one phone app) in World of Warcraft: Legion, and they have made pre-raid gearing much smoother.
Queue for Bonus Reward Heroic Dungeons: Bobsatchels Bobsatchels: The prior addons I had used for finding heroic dungeon satchels did not work in Legion. The humbly named Bobsatchels gets the job done. It has a slick user interface, exactly the options you would want, and most importantly, it works.

    There is no more PvP gear in Legion. Players can get gear from PvE and they can get gear from PvP, and PvP gear can be used in PvE and vice versa. According to Blizzard, &ldquo;in Legion, gear is gear, regardless of where you earned it, with no PvP-specific stats or fluctuating item levels, and the best players in both PvP and PvE content will be able to earn the best gear.

    I&rsquo;ve been very busy with invasions &amp; World of Warcraft refer-a-friend leveling. Check this post on Reddit for a how-to guide and tips. You can do this by yourself - run two windows of Warcraft on your own computer for two different Warcraft subscriptions. Even if you start Friday evening, you can likely get a full server of characters on your main account to 90 over the weekend before invasions end when Legion launches.

    Legion launches in just a few weeks. You may have pre-ordered the game digitally from Blizzard. If you have, you&rsquo;re all set. If not, now is a great time to order the game (Amazon US store link). If you&rsquo;re like me, and you want a physical copy, ordering from Amazon is an excellent choice. Shipping should be free, you should receive the game on launch day, and, if you have Amazon Prime, they currently offer a 20% discount on pre-orders and recently released games!
