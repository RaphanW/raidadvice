<h1 id="mount-up">Mount Up</h1>
<p><strong>EDIT 2016-10-11: Follow up post <a href="http://raidadvice.com/mount-macros-revisited/">here</a>.</strong> The following is my Mount Up macro. I assign the &ldquo;favorite mounts&rdquo; icon to it, and enjoy using it to get around in Legion. <code>/dismount /castrandom [mod:alt]Azure Water Strider, Crimson Water Strider /cast [mod:shift]Grand Expedition Yak;[mod:ctrl]Mekgineer's Chopper /cast [flyable]X-53 Touring Rocket /cancelform [stance:1/2] /run C_MountJournal.SummonByID(0)</code> Here&rsquo;s what it does: If mounted, I dismount. If I am holding alt, cast either Azure Water Stider or Crimson Water Strider. If I am holding shift, cast my Yak for repairs and transmog. If I am holding control, cast MekGineer&rsquo;s Chopper for a two-person ground mount. If none of the above, make sure I am not in bear or cat form (if you skip this step, the next doesn&rsquo;t work), and summon a random favorite mount. This allows me to set both ground and flying mounts as my favorite mounts for use in the Broken Isles, cast a water-walker/shop/transmog mount/2-seater if I need it, and cast a 2-seater flying mount if I happen to be in a flyable zone. Consider this alternative: <code>/dismount /cast [mod:alt]Crimson Water Strider;[mod:shift]Traveler's Tundra Mammoth;[mod:ctrl]Sandstone Drake /castrandom [flyable]Red Flying Cloud, Black Drake /run C_MountJournal.SummonByID(0)</code> This macro would work for a non-druid. It would cast Crimson Water Strider with alt, Traveler&rsquo;s Tundra Mammoth with shift, and Sandstone Drake with control for a two-person flying or ground mount. If none of the above, and in a flying zone, cast either Red Flying Cloud or Black Drake. If not in a flying zone, cast a favorite mount. You can obviously change the mount names if you have different mounts or preferences. Happy trails!</p>
<h1 id="do-mythics">Do Mythics</h1>
<p><a href="https://wago.io/Ek906edj-">This weakaura</a>, by Spinalcrack, the first of his name, Co-GM of <!-- raw HTML omitted --> on US-Sargeras, Assistant Administrator at <a href="http://www.howtopriest.com">www.howtopriest.com</a>, and Protector of the Realm, displays which mythic dungeons you have yet to complete each week when you open up the dungeon journal. There&rsquo;s a picture of exactly how it looks at the <a href="https://wago.io/Ek906edj-">wago.io page</a>. This is deceptively useful! I had thought checking my calendar, figuring out which ones I <em>had</em> done, and subtracting would be just as easy. It&rsquo;s not even close. Just opening the journal and seeing which mythics I have not finished yet is amazing. Hopefully this helps you wrap up the last few you need to do this weekend. I resisted installing this weakaura for a week even though Spinal is the co-GM of my guild and suggested it to us.Â Once you install it, it feels like it should have always been there and you never want to go back. That&rsquo;s pretty much the universal opinion of everyone I&rsquo;ve gotten to try it.</p>
