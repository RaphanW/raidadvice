<p>Right now, this site is maintained by me, Raphael. In Hellfire Citadel, I played as a Holy Paladin with the 2-day mythic guild <a href="http://www.cakeplantation.com/">Cake Plantation</a> (<a href="http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/sargeras/Cake+Plantation/rating.tier18">wowprogress</a>). We finished US 167 and were around the 10th US 2-day guild to finish Tier 18. I was an officer and then GM before we wound down the guild. <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/sargeras/Anphar/advanced">Armory</a>, <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/character/9689427/latest#boss=0">Logs</a>.
